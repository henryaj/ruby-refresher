# Ruby Refresher

At this point, we've had a couple of weeks away from Ruby proper – getting to grips with things like JavaScript, CoffeeScript, and node.js.

Here, we're given some Ruby challenges to solve. I think I had some elegant solutions to some of these problems – and after a fornight of fighting with JavaScript testing frameworks, this challenge was a joy.

### The rules (from the original challenge)

* Try and get the RSpec tests to pass (but not by cheating - i.e. hardcoding the expected value)
* You shouldn't need any extra libraries or gems
* The cleaner your code the better!
* Googling is fine as usual

### Running the tests

Clone the repo and run `rspec questions_spec.rb` from the root directory to see how well I did.
